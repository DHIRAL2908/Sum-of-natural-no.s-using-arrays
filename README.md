# Sum-of-natural-no.s-using-arrays
Not the simplest way, but you can calculate sum of natural no.s with arrays too. It asks you the no. until which you want the sum of. It will do the rest.
Again, there is a simpler way of doing this if you prefer...(Just ask Goggle if you want a smaller and simpler code).
